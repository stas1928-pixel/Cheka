# Opening Trainer — PLAN.md

State file for this project. Read this first each session; update it at the
end of each job. The full product spec and *why* lives in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`;
this file only records decisions, ownership, scope, and current job status.

Started: 2026-09-15. Local-only personal project. Repo is local, never pushed.

## Architecture decisions (locked)

### Delivery
- **Static PWA, no build step.** Plain HTML/CSS and ES modules under `js/`,
  served by any static HTTP server. "Add to Home Screen" on Android.
  No framework, no bundler, no npm dependencies. Node is used only for tests.
- **No backend, no accounts, no sync.** Single user, one device.
- **Dependencies are vendored, not CDN-loaded.** `vendor/chess.js` is
  chess.js 1.0.0 ESM (the prototype's cdnjs URL was a 404; 1.x ships no
  browser global). Pin by copying the file; note the version in
  `docs/sources.md`.
- **No service worker yet.** Add one only when offline use becomes a real
  need. Until then the app needs network to load.

### Data ownership (which system owns what)
| Data | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Repertoire tree (2 openings, main lines, branches) | `js/repertoire.js`, hand-edited | Two openings only. No editor UI. Tests prove legality + canonical SAN. |
| Training progress (accuracy, streaks, weak spots) | `localStorage` via `js/progress.js` | Export/import JSON from Settings is the backup. |
| Move legality, board state, SAN, PGN parsing | **chess.js** | Never reimplement rules. |
| Master-game move stats | **Lichess Opening Explorer** (read-only, in review mode) | Needs a personal API token (see gotchas). In-memory cache per page load only. |
| Position evaluation | **Stockfish WASM** — job 7, not started | Only for building punishment branches, never during drills. |
| User's game history | **Chess.com Public API** (read-only, no auth) | Fetched on demand; only the derived gap report is stored. |
| Settings (sound, deviation chance, tokens, username) | `localStorage` via `js/settings.js` | Device-local. |

### What we will NOT build
- A general opening editor or import-any-PGN system.
- Multi-user, login, cloud storage, or server code of any kind.
- A native Android app or Play Store distribution.
- A board library or drag-and-drop engine — click-to-move on a CSS grid works.
- A spaced-repetition scheduler beyond weakest-first ordering, until real
  usage shows that isn't enough. (Not even weakest-first yet: lines are
  drilled in order, deviations are random.)
- Caching layers for Lichess or Chess.com data beyond one page load.

### Vendor gotchas (verified, see docs/sources.md for dates)
- **chess.js 1.0.0** — `import { Chess } from '../vendor/chess.js'`.
  `move()` **throws** on an illegal move (does not return null). Verbose
  moves carry `san/from/to/captured/promotion`. `loadPgn()` wants headers on
  their own lines; we strip headers and comments and feed movetext only.
- **Lichess Explorer** — both `explorer.lichess.ovh` and
  `explorer.lichess.org` answer **401** without a token (confirmed from two
  networks and from a browser with a dummy token). Token: create at
  https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token/create?description=Opening%20Trainer
  with no scopes; paste into Settings. `play=` wants **UCI**, not SAN.
- **Chess.com Public API** — no auth, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.
  Serial requests unlimited, parallel may 429 → we fetch months one at a
  time. PGNs contain `{[%clk …]}` comments and `1...` numbering; parser
  handles both (checked against a live game).
- **Stockfish WASM (job 7, unverified)** — multi-threaded builds need
  COOP/COEP headers a static host may not send; plan on a single-threaded
  build in a Worker. Workers must be same-origin, so the engine files must be
  vendored (several MB). Licence is GPL-3; fine for a personal tool. Verify
  build, size and UCI handshake before writing the branch-builder UI.

## Jobs

Order follows "Suggested next steps" in the brief. Jobs 1–6 and 8 were done
in one session on 2026-09-15 at the owner's explicit request (normally one
job per session); each still got its own commit.

| # | Job | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Unzip, `git init`, write PLAN.md, first commit | done 2026-09-15 |
| 1 | Elephant Gambit as second selectable line (Black); home screen picker; board flips for Black | done 2026-09-15 |
| 2 | Repertoire as `mainLine` + `branches`; opponent deviates into a branch (chance in Settings) | done 2026-09-15 |
| 3 | Review mode: line picker (main + branches), stepping, tap-to-jump | done 2026-09-15 |
| 4 | Feedback: square flash + Web Audio sounds, mute toggle | done 2026-09-15 |
| 5 | Progress in localStorage: accuracy, streaks, weak spots, export/import/reset | done 2026-09-15 |
| 6 | Lichess Explorer panel in review mode (token in Settings) | done 2026-09-15 — needs the owner's token to see data |
| 7 | Stockfish WASM + punishment-branch eval-cutoff builder | **todo** — next job. Do the vendor verification first, as a session of its own. |
| 8 | Chess.com import + gap report | done 2026-09-15 — needs the owner's username for a real scan |

Rules for every job:
- Small enough to build, test, and understand in one session.
- Explain reasoning in code comments (the owner is learning to code).
- `npm test` green and a browser check before commit.
- Update this table, commit, stop.

### Job 7 sketch (do not start without reading the gotchas above)
1. Vendor a single-threaded Stockfish WASM build; prove `uci` → `uciok` and
   `go depth 12` → `info … score cp N` in a Worker from the static server.
2. `js/engine.js`: `evaluate(fen, depth) -> centipawns from White's view`,
   with a queue so one position is analysed at a time.
3. `js/branchBuilder.js` (pure, tested): given (opening, deviation ply,
   opponent move, candidate response line) and a list of evals per ply,
   apply the brief's decaying threshold: ≥ +1.5 within 6 moves → cut there;
   else ≥ +0.5 later → cut there; never reached → discard.
4. A small "Build branch" screen in review mode that takes a gap from the
   Chess.com report and walks it with the engine, showing the eval per move,
   and offers to add the result to `repertoire.js` (as copy-pasteable JSON —
   the repertoire stays a hand-edited file).

## Testing
- `npm test` runs `node --test` over `tests/*.test.mjs`: 41 tests covering
  repertoire legality/canonical SAN, tree helpers, settings, progress,
  explorer client, Chess.com parsing/walk/aggregation. DOM code (`app.js`,
  `feedback.js`) is checked by hand in the browser preview.
- Coverage target ≥ 90 % on the pure modules; not measured yet (node's
  `--experimental-test-coverage` can report it when wanted).

## Docs
- `docs/sources.md` — every external URL consulted, with date.
- `docs/LAYOUT.md` — file map, run/test, how to get it on the phone, moving.
- `docs/UNINSTALL.md` — removal order.

## Decided 2026-09-15 (after the first real data scan)
- **Scotch = Scotch Gambit (4.Bc4), not the Four Knights.** 421 games scanned;
  4.Nxd4 appeared zero times, 4.Bc4 twenty-four times. Main line is now the
  Max Lange Attack, top master move at every ply.
- **Branches cover what real opponents play, not what theory prefers.** Every
  uncovered move from the scan with 2+ occurrences now has a reply, chosen by
  best score in the Lichess 1400–1800 database. Branches are 1–3 moves, "far
  enough to be clearly better", per the owner's instruction. They are NOT
  engine-verified — that is job 7.
- **Re-scanning is the regression test for repertoire changes.** Complete
  lines went 0→14 (Scotch) and 0→18 (Elephant) on the same 421 games.

## Open questions (owner's call)
- **Hosting for the phone.** Same-Wi-Fi Python server vs. a static host.
  See `docs/LAYOUT.md`. Nothing personal is in the repo, so a public static
  host is acceptable privacy-wise, but it is the owner's decision.
- **Chess.com username** — `stas1928`, confirmed 2026-09-15.
- **Lichess token** — the first token was shared in a chat transcript and
  should be revoked and replaced. The replacement must be pasted into the
  Settings field on the device itself; it is never stored in this repo.
- **Elephant Gambit main line** — checked against masters and kept
  (4.Qe2 is 75% there). The 3.Nxe5 reply was corrected to 3...Bd6.
- **A few of your own habits differ from the tree**: you play 4.d5 against
  3...d6 (tree says 4.dxe5, better score) and 4...Bd7 against 4.Bb5+ (tree
  says 4...c6, 63% vs 48%). The tree teaches the better move on purpose;
  say the word if you would rather it match your habit.
- **Sound design** — WebAudio oscillator tones chosen (no asset files). Tune
  or replace if they get annoying.
